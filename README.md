### Sample Test Data:
- **Age**: 34
- **Income**: $54,444
- **Employment**: 5.5 years
- **Loan Amount**: $3,455
- **Credit Grade**: A
- **Default History**: Yes/No (try both!)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
- **Backend Logic**: Client-side JavaScript (ML algorithm implementation)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient designs
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## 📊 Machine Learning Model

The system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that evaluates multiple factors:

- **Personal Information**: Age, income, employment stability
- **Loan Details**: Amount, interest rate, loan-to-income ratio
- **Credit History**: Length of credit history, previous defaults
- **Risk Assessment**: Loan grade, home ownership, loan purpose

### Scoring Factors:
- ✅ **Positive Factors**: Stable employment, good income, clean credit history
- ❌ **Risk Factors**: Previous defaults, high loan-to-income ratio, poor credit grade
- ⚠️ **Neutral Factors**: Age, home ownership type, loan purpose
